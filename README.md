# Movie-Problem (Work in progress)

This repository is for publishing solution for one of the movie rating problem that I worked on.

Multiple iterations were tried before reaching to the final solution. 

Code is developed on R and ensembling of different algorithms is tried to improve the performance. There is also a test file where final predictions have to be made. Unfortunately I do not have the solution for this. I can only test the algorithm on samples taken from training file. 

Any suggestions to further improve the model is highly welcome.
